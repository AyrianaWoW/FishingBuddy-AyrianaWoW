Rehost of Vanilla v1.12.1 Fishing Buddy version 0.8.9 Beta 11

From what I've seen, this version seems to have additional addons for integration with TitanPanel, a primitive early version of an 'Outfitter' style addon for Fishing Outfits, and a separate tracking frame.

All files will be uploaded as-is. but I'll explain what each one does here to the best of my knowledge.

+ FB_OutfitDisplayFrame - a helper addon that 'connects' FishingBuddy and OutfitDisplayFrame so you can use it to configure a fishing outfit with a basic GUI; requires FishingBuddy and OutfitDisplayFrame
+ FB_Titan - a helper addon for use with the 'Titan' addon panel for Vanilla; requires FishingBuddy and Titan
+ FB_TrackingFrame - a helper addon that shows the tracking frame for Fishing Buddy; requires FishingBuddy
+ FishingBuddy - main addon folder; required
+ OutfitDisplayFrame - a separate addon designed to show outfits in a window; standalone

This github is NOT compatible with the Github Addons Manager.  Please only install these manually if you choose to do so!

Make sure all files in the main folder are in a folder called 'FishingBuddy'.

All other folders (OutfitDisplayFrame, FB_ folders) should be loaded as separate addons/modules from outside of the main FishingBuddy folder.

If this seems complicated, just use the main version on the Turtle WoW wiki instead!

Absolututely NO support for errors, glitches, or otherwise will be provided!
